We are on a mission to build a global open crowdsourced Internet of Things data network.

Let's make *Adelaide, South Australia* an active part of a global free Internet of Things (IOT) data network and create more open data! 

Growing Data Foundation (GDF) is an organisation formed to provide the back-end infrastructure and open software to enable community organisations to easily leverage cloud and IoT technologies for the purposes of data collection and dissemination. 

GDF has established connections with Partner service providers to access their community sponsorship opportunities, reducing the technical and cost barriers facing citizen science and community organisations wishing to collect and disseminate data. 

Our teamsâ€™ core values revolve around restoring health and happiness to communities and the ecosystems upon which they rely.

 All work is focused on creation of open source, open data and open educational resources which help communities flourish and become more resilient. 

 It is hoped that in the future the Growing Data Foundation will collaborate with other environmental organisations to broaden the range of products and services available to the community.
