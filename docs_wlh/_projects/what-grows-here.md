Whether you are a revegetation project team member, landscaper or gardener the 'What Grows Here?' app will help you find plants that best suit your space and needs. Learners can learn about local bird life. 

### The app

See detailed descriptions of over 1000 Australian Native Plants ranging from trees and shrubs to ground-covers and grasses.

The well-being of all life on our planet is under increasing pressure from climate change.

It has been known for decades that part of the solution lies in repairing our natural environment through tree planting and restoring forest to areas that have been cleared.

The 'What grows here?' app will empower you to and be part of the solution and help you plant the right tree, at the right time in the right place.

### 'What Grows Here?' history

'What Grows Here?' products were developed as part of the Unleased SA node of GovHack in 2014.

'What Grows Here?' won the following Unleashed SA and GovHack prizes:

- Premiers Award: Unleashed SA Competition

Visit the [South Australian Unleashed](http://uladl.com/) and [GovHack](https://www.govhack.org/) websites to find out about the competition and see the amazing projects different teams have created using open data.

As a result of participating in GovHack and winning awards that supported the development of the 'What Grows Here?' app and Learning Hub, the Nature Ninjas formed the Growing Data Foundation. The foundation will bring like-minded people together to work on open sustainable projects that support the community.
