We are advocating for the development of a city-wide Internet of Things data network in Adelaide. A network that can talk to the internet without 3G or WiFi (no and has low battery usage, long range and low bandwidth extends opportunities for makers, inventors and creatives.  

The advantage of this technology for Maker and citizen science projects is that it allows 'things' to talk to the internet without 3G or WiFi - meaning that if a box is located in a remote area; data can still be obtained on conditions, effectiveness... or whatever it is you are measuring/monitoring.

Ansterdam has successfully demonstrated the value of this concept by creating the [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) using a new a new technology named LoraWANâ„¢ that is perfect for Internet of Things projects. 

Adelaide has many citizen science projects, makers, tinkerers and creators who will benefit from such a network.
