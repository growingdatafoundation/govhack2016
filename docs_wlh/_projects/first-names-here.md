### About the project

Names and language are not just words - they are closely linked to our identity and culture.  

Around Australia Aboriginal communities and groups are reviving and sharing their languages through story, song and through community and formal eduction.  As you walk around this app allows you to see the first names for places and, possibly later, for plants and things.  

You will be able to see what Aboriginal communities predominant in a particular area -- fixed borders are a very western concept and we want to reflect this by avoiding drawing firm regional borders but instead showing you where there is a predominance from a particular community and where there is a shared presence from a number of communities.

As well a general interest - this app could be used as a learning tool for schools to provoke discussion and learning linked to the Australian Curriculum Across Curriculum Prioritys, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures
